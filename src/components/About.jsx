            Hi, Iâ€™m <span style={{ fontWeight: 900 }}>Naveen</span>!! I am a passionate web developer who loves creating
          clean, responsive, and user-friendly
          websites. My focus is on building modern web solutions using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy turning
          creative ideas into real projects that not only look good but also perform efficiently across all devices.
          I constantly strive to learn new technologies and improve my coding skills to stay updated with the
          fast-growing web industry. My interest lies in front-end development, but I am also exploring back-end
          concepts to become a full-stack developer in the future.
          When working on a project, I pay attention to detail, prioritize performance, and aim to deliver an excellent
          user experience.
